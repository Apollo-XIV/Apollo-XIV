Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alex! I'm a DevOps engineer working in the North West. Professionally, I specialise in AWS and GitHub, as well as managing it all through Terraform. In my free time I like to work in all sorts of languages, but particularly Gleam, Rust, and Nix. I'm currently rewriting my main projects (like my homelab setup), but watch this space!
